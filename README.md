# calculator-project


With this project i wanted to get my SCSS design close to the Apple iPhone calculator. As well as this use my javascript functions to make it provide all the necessary functions of a calculator and make it responsive so it will work across a range of different devices. 

Using what i have learnt across the last two weeks i have implemented HTML, CSS, SCSS, BEM and Javascript to make it work. To organise my code i have created multiple folders for the SCSS files so that the main file isn't convoluted. I have also created seperate functions that can be called in Javascript rather than just having them as callback functions with the click events.
